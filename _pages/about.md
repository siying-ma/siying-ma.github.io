Welcome to my personal website! I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Statistics under supervision of [Dr. Jiguo Cao](https://www.sfu.ca/science/stat/cao/) and [Dr. Lloyd Elloitt](https://elliottlab.ca) in the Department of [Statistics and Actuarial Science](https://www.sfu.ca/stat-actsci.html) at [Simon Fraser University](https://www.sfu.ca), specializing in mathematical and statistical modelling, scienfical machine learning, and disease analytics.  Before SFU, I completed my Master of Science in Statistics under supervision of [Dr. Laura Cowen](https://cowenlab.weebly.com) in the Department of [Mathematics and Statistics](https://www.uvic.ca/science/math-statistics/index.php) at [University of Victoria](https://www.uvic.ca) where I developed disease analytic models based on ecological frameworks to estimate underreported COVID-19 cases. I also hold a Bachelor of Science in [Statistics](https://fem.ecnu.edu.cn/femenglish/) from [East China Normal University](https://english.ecnu.edu.cn), where my undergraduate research focused on eQTL analysis with auxiliary information.
